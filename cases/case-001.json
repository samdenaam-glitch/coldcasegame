    "summary": "Renowned violinist Evelyn Vance disappeared after her final performance at the Royal Symphony Hall on November 15, 1987. No ransom note, no witnesses, just an empty dressing room and a broken violin string. The case went cold after 3 months of investigation.",
    
    "backstory": "Evelyn Vance, 34, was at the peak of her career. Her final performance of the season was sold out, but she never took her final bow. Colleagues described her as 'distracted' in the days leading up to the disappearance. She had recently ended a professional partnership with fellow violinist Adrian Volkov, who was reportedly furious about being replaced.",

        "explanation": "Adrian Volkov, devastated by being replaced after 5 years of partnership, planned to ruin Evelyn's career. He stole a stagehand uniform, forged a backstage pass, and confronted her after the performance. The reference to Professor Aris (their shared mentor) in the threat letter was personal - Aris had chosen Evelyn as his 'musical heir'. Volkov never intended to kill her, only to scare her into quitting music. When she fought back (breaking her violin string), he panicked and used chloroform. He kept her sedated but released her when guilt overcame him. Evelyn, traumatized and fearing further attacks, chose to disappear and start a new life.",
        
        "outcome": "Evelyn Vance was found alive in 1992 living under a new name in Scotland. She refused to press charges, wanting to leave the past behind. Volkov was convicted of kidnapping and served 8 years. He never played violin again.",
